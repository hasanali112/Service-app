## Feedback for the Task:

Working on this task was a rewarding experience as it allowed me to implement various design and functionality aspects to create a cohesive user interface. The project involved creating a visually appealing and responsive footer component using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, which was a good opportunity to apply my front-end development skills.

### Challenges Encountered:

- Custom Styling: Achieving the exact styling of the background gradient and elements required some adjustments and customization of Tailwind's default configurations. Extending the theme with custom gradients and colors was necessary to match the design closely.

- Responsiveness: Ensuring that the layout looked good on all screen sizes was a bit challenging, particularly for the contact information section. I had to carefully adjust the flex and spacing utilities for different breakpoints to maintain consistency across devices.

- SVG Icons: Integrating the icons with appropriate styling while keeping the component lightweight required some effort. I opted for inline SVGs to have more control over their styling and to ensure consistency with the design.

### Overall Experience:

The task was a great opportunity to refine my skills in creating responsive and visually appealing components using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The process allowed me to tackle common front-end challenges, such as responsive design and component reusability. I'm satisfied with the final outcome and feel that the component meets the project requirements while providing room for future enhancements.

Overall, this task has strengthened my confidence in designing and developing user-friendly interfaces using modern front-end technologies.
